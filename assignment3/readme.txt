The files here are assisted tools for using the project codes here: https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk

The using instructions:
1. git clone https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk
2. cd neuraltalk
3. mkdir checkpoints
4. cp ../models/* checkpoints/
5. cp ../*.sh ./

Now you can run the shell scripts (usage can be found in the head of scripts).

P.S. benchmark_solution.py is the benchmark programs;
P.S.2. parse_data_set.py is used for generating essential training information from flicker8k.
After training, you can have your own model.

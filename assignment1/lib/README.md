This folder should contain the required jar files.

They can be downloaded from: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/bytedeco/javacv-platform/1.3.2/javacv-platform-1.3.2-bin.zip

Only three of them are required:
- javacpp.jar
- opencv.jar
- opencv-<platform>.jar (e.g. opencv-linux-x86_64.jar)

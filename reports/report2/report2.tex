This assignment 2 report describes the Viola and Jones's method{\ref{origin}} which can detect a specified object very rapidly.
Their method uses a machine learning method named AdaBoost to both select

The performance is fully depending on the training data.

The prediction result is very stable, using the same model to predict will always get the same result.

% how to come over the slightly tilted face (the Haar basis features can do that)
In principle, any kind of face can be detected if the training data have this

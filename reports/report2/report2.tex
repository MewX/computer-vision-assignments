This assignment 2 report describes the Viola and Jones's method{\cite{origin}} which can detect a specified object very rapidly.
Their method uses a machine learning method named AdaBoost to both select

\section{The Problem}
The problem is to detect face(s) in an input image, and output the image with each face marked with a bounding box.
Although it looks very simple and we don't need to recognize a specific face, the challenge is to detect all the faces in real time.
Because in any normal image, there are so many possible positions and sizes for a single face,
and it's impossible to try every sub-window of them due to the huge computational cost.

Moreover, an input image is not always predictable. The head direction, face integrity, environmental light brightness,
camera features, image quality, etc. can often bring issues to the face detection problem.
And to simplify the problem, the method from Viola and Jones demonstrates with a frontal face detection system,
which means the effects of ``head direction'' and ``face integrity'' are ignored.

The performance is fully depending on the training data.

The prediction result is very stable, using the same model to predict will always get the same result.

In principle, any kind of face can be detected if the training data have this
